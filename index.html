    Event handlers are functions that are evoked when the event happens (ie., on form submission) -->
    <!-- Make sure your event handler is evoked with an event argument - Don't worry about defining the event argument. HTML/Javascript will define it under the hood -->
    <!-- Make sure your input has a "search" type and give it an id and name of your choice -->
